My current research focuses on developing novel deep learning techniques for robust identification of airplane condensation trails in images. Condensation trails are important indicators for aviation-related climate impact studies yet differentiating them from other cloud formations remains challenging. To improve detection, I am pioneering attended variational autoencoders to learn efficient latent space representations of both segmented and unsegmented condensation trail images. This allows for precise clustering based on visual features. Additionally, I am implementing a deep energy-based model utilizing Langevin sampling to optimize latent displacement across clusters.
This specialized framework integrates reconstruction, segmentation, and sampling to achieve state-of-the-art performance in condensation trail recognition. My research aims to overcome limitations in existing atmospheric studies by leveraging AI to unlock new insights from complex meteorological image data. The work will help drive progress in aviation emission analysis and climate modeling through robust identification of airplane exhaust trails. I am eager to continue developing novel deep learning techniques that push the boundaries of what is possible in earth sciences and climate study through computational power and cutting-edge algorithms.
