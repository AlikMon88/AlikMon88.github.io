My research pioneered a new technique using cutting-edge AI to reconstruct images of the moon's most mysterious terrains - the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar poles. These areas within deep, ragged craters at the extreme north and south of the moon have never seen sunlight, remaining dark for billions of years. The utterly lightless conditions make imaging these regions impossible with normal cameras. However, data gathered by ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 orbiter presented a unique opportunity to illuminate the unknown using transformative algorithms.
I developed a novel computational framework leveraging guided diffusion models and reference-less contrast adjustment to process the Chandrayaan-2 observations of the permanently shadowed areas. Despite the complete absence of light, my approach enabled imaging of surface features within the shadows for the first time through physics-based reconstructions. The breakthrough results provided remarkable new details about the topography and composition of these previously hidden terrains, which could contain troves of frozen water.
Achieving state-of-the-art image reconstructions of the moon's permanently shadowed craters demonstrates the huge potential of AI in space exploration and planetary science. Analysis of the terrain and identification of surface water in these regions were impossible until now. The insights unlocked by my pioneering technique will help guide future lunar missions, especially Chandrayaan-3, while advancing our understanding of the moon's geology and environment.
