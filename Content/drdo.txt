My research focused on optimizing the thermal properties of Single Quantum Well (SQW) lasers to improve performance through precise modeling. SQW lasers are semiconductor devices that rely on complex interactions between temperature, current density, and other constrained parameters. However, finding the optimal configuration is incredibly challenging due to the multidimensional complexity. To tackle this, I pioneered a novel approach using Trust Constraint and SLSQP optimization techniques to constrain the thermal variables and maximize laser output. By reframing the multivariate maximization as a genetic programming problem, I achieved robust modeling of thermal properties and prediction of optimal designs.
The breakthrough work demonstrated that combining constraint optimization, sequential programming, and evolutionary algorithms can provide pathways to effectively modeling even highly complex systems like SQW lasers. My specialized techniques resulted in unmatched accuracy in modeling the nuanced thermal dynamics within the quantum well structure. The optimization framework accounted for all constrained parameters to identify ideal configurations for high lasing yields. This research proves the power of merging computational optimization, machine learning, and physics-based techniques to advance discoveries even in convoluted multidimensional systems.
