My research pioneered new machine learning techniques for detecting gravitational waves in noisy data from LIGO's detectors. Gravitational wave signals are extremely faint within the detectors' time-series output. To amplify the patterns, I implemented constant Q transform and butterworth bandpass filtering as preprocessing steps. The resulting spectrograms offered visual representations of the data's frequency composition over time. However, pinpointing the presence of gravitational waves remained challenging due to noise and interference.
To address this, I developed a novel convolutional neural network architecture that classified spectrogram inputs, identifying those containing gravitational wave signals versus noise. The model detected patterns within the frequency information that confirmed the presence of these elusive waves. Through training on labeled LIGO data, the network learned to isolate the signals with over 90% accuracy despite a low signal-to-noise ratio. This breakthrough demonstrates AI's potential to uncover hidden insights in complex scientific data. My work enables rapid identification of new events as LIGO continues surveying for gravitational disturbances. I'm committed to pushing machine learning into new frontiers by developing innovative techniques that extract pivotal discoveries from noisy data.
