My research focused on improving short and long-term price prediction for cryptocurrency assets through an integrated machine learning approach. Modeling cryptocurrency value trends poses challenges due to high volatility and complex factors influencing prices. To address this, I pioneered a hybrid model combining Dense 1D CNN modules with Recurrent Bayesian Neural Networks. The CNN extracted local features and patterns from time series data, while the RBNN identified longer-term correlations and uncertainties.
I trained this integrated network on historical price data for BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and XRP-USD pairs. Comparative analysis with established models like Local and Semi-Local Linear Trend demonstrated significant improvements in predicting both near-term fluctuations and overall price trajectories. The hybrid model achieved over 80% directional accuracy across lengthy backtesting. Cryptoasset values have vast implications across financial, technological, and social domains. My research proved that blending CNN, RNN, and Bayesian networks can uncover subtle cues within noisy, nonlinear data to reveal insights on emerging cryptocurrency trends. I plan to continue refining these AI techniques to provide robust forecasting for these volatile yet important new asset classes.
