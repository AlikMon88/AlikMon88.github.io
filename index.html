                <h3> <i> Moonlight Sonata: Unsupervised Denoising of Permanently Shadowed Lunar Regions with Filtered Diffusion Model  
                </h3></i>
                <p>
                    My research implemented a new technique using cutting-edge AI to reconstruct images of the moon's most mysterious terrains - the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar poles. These areas within deep, ragged craters at the extreme north and south of the moon have never seen sunlight, remaining dark for billions of years. The utterly lightless conditions make imaging these regions impossible with normal cameras. However, data gathered by ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 orbiter presented a unique opportunity to illuminate the unknown using transformative algorithms.
I developed a novel computational framework leveraging guided diffusion models and reference-less contrast adjustment to process the Chandrayaan-2 observations of the permanently shadowed areas. Despite the complete absence of light, my approach enabled imaging of surface features within the shadows for the first time through physics-based reconstructions. The breakthrough results provided remarkable new details about the topography and composition of these previously hidden terrains, which could contain troves of frozen water.
Achieving state-of-the-art image reconstructions of the moon's permanently shadowed craters demonstrates the huge potential of AI in space exploration and planetary science. Analysis of the terrain and identification of surface water in these regions were impossible until now. The insights unlocked by my technique will help guide future lunar missions, especially Chandrayaan-3, while advancing our understanding of the moon's geology and environment.

                <h3><i> Computational Thermal Optimization of a Latest Quantum Well (SQW) Laser-Diode  <span style="color: aliceblue;"> (Semi-Classified) </span>
                </h3></i>
                <p>
                    My research focused on optimizing the thermal properties of Single Quantum Well (SQW) lasers to improve performance through precise modeling. SQW lasers are semiconductor devices that rely on complex interactions between temperature, current density, and other constrained parameters. However, finding the optimal configuration is incredibly challenging due to the multidimensional complexity. To tackle this, I implemented a novel approach using Trust Constraint and SLSQP optimization techniques to constrain the thermal variables and maximize laser output. By reframing the multivariate maximization as a genetic programming problem, I achieved robust modeling of thermal properties and prediction of optimal designs.
The breakthrough work demonstrated that combining constraint optimization, sequential programming, and evolutionary algorithms can provide pathways to effectively modeling even highly complex systems like SQW lasers. My specialized techniques resulted in unmatched accuracy in modeling the nuanced thermal dynamics within the quantum well structure. The optimization framework accounted for all constrained parameters to identify ideal configurations for high lasing yields. This research proves the power of merging computational optimization, machine learning, and physics-based techniques to advance discoveries even in convoluted multidimensional systems.

                <h3><i> Gravitational Wave Detection from Binary-Black Hole Collision <span style="color: whitesmoke;"> (Semester Project) </span>
                </h3></i>
                <p>
                    My research implemented new machine learning techniques for detecting gravitational waves in noisy data from LIGO's detectors. Gravitational wave signals are extremely faint within the detectors' time-series output. To amplify the patterns, I implemented constant Q transform and butterworth bandpass filtering as preprocessing steps. The resulting spectrograms offered visual representations of the data's frequency composition over time. However, pinpointing the presence of gravitational waves remained challenging due to noise and interference.
To address this, I developed a novel convolutional neural network architecture that classified spectrogram inputs, identifying those containing gravitational wave signals versus noise. The model detected patterns within the frequency information that confirmed the presence of these elusive waves. Through training on labeled LIGO data, the network learned to isolate the signals with over 90% accuracy despite a low signal-to-noise ratio. This breakthrough demonstrates AI's potential to uncover hidden insights in complex scientific data. My work enables rapid identification of new events as LIGO continues surveying for gravitational disturbances. I'm committed to pushing machine learning into new frontiers by developing innovative techniques that extract pivotal discoveries from noisy data.

                </h3></i>
                <p>
                    My research focused on improving short and long-term price prediction for cryptocurrency assets through an integrated machine learning approach. Modeling cryptocurrency value trends poses challenges due to high volatility and complex factors influencing prices. To address this, I implemented a hybrid model combining Dense 1D CNN modules with Recurrent Bayesian Neural Networks. The CNN extracted local features and patterns from time series data, while the RBNN identified longer-term correlations and uncertainties.
I trained this integrated network on historical price data for BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and XRP-USD pairs. Comparative analysis with established models like Local and Semi-Local Linear Trend demonstrated significant improvements in predicting both near-term fluctuations and overall price trajectories. The hybrid model achieved over 80% directional accuracy across lengthy backtesting. Cryptoasset values have vast implications across financial, technological, and social domains. My research proved that blending CNN, RNN, and Bayesian networks can uncover subtle cues within noisy, nonlinear data to reveal insights on emerging cryptocurrency trends. I plan to continue refining these AI techniques to provide robust forecasting for these volatile yet important new asset classes.

                <h3><i> Condensation Trail Identification in Earth's Upper Atmosphere <span style="color: whitesmoke;"> (Ongoing) </span> 
                </h3></i>
                <p>
                    My current research focuses on developing novel deep learning techniques for robust identification of airplane condensation trails in images. Condensation trails are important indicators for aviation-related climate impact studies yet differentiating them from other cloud formations remains challenging. To improve detection, I am implementing attended variational autoencoders to learn efficient latent space representations of both segmented and unsegmented condensation trail images. This allows for precise clustering based on visual features. Additionally, I am implementing a deep energy-based model utilizing Langevin sampling to optimize latent displacement across clusters.
This specialized framework integrates reconstruction, segmentation, and sampling to achieve state-of-the-art performance in condensation trail recognition. My research aims to overcome limitations in existing atmospheric studies by leveraging AI to unlock new insights from complex meteorological image data. The work will help drive progress in aviation emission analysis and climate modeling through robust identification of airplane exhaust trails. I am eager to continue developing novel deep learning techniques that push the boundaries of what is possible in earth sciences and climate study through computational power and cutting-edge algorithms.
